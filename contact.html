      <p>
        If you're interested in discussing any of my projects, technology, how bad Texas barbeque is, or how
        cool hippos are then feel free to reach out. I'm available at:

      </ul>
      <p>
        Putting all of those logos in really pointed out how blue everything is these days. I should change the
        theme of this website...

    <!-- Recruiters -->
    <div>
      <h1>For Recruiters</h1>
      <p class="strong">
        Recruiters that have made it this far should  email me at josh [dot] grancell [at] gmail [dot] com. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an email address that is exclusively used on this page, and will let me know you're not just 
        someone that scraped my email from a database and are blanket emailing the entire world. You're much 
        less likely to get ignored then on Linkedin or using my main email address.
      </p>
      <p class="strong">
        I am not currently actively searching for a new job or career, however I'm happy to network with 1-2
        recruiters, especially if you specialize in the Philadelpha metropolitan area. I also am always open
        to exceptional offers from headhunters, which is how I've taken my last 3 jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am willing to entertain offers for positions that primarily involve any of the below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Terraform</li>
        <li>Golang</li>
        <li>Site Reliability Engineering</li>
        <li>DevOps Management</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am willing to relocate to interesting and exciting places, such as Hawaii, an island in the Carribbean,
        Europe or the UK (we used to live in Germany, and I have basic language skills in French) or southern New 
        Jersey (not a joke, our family is from there and my wife's extended family still lives there).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have small children, so I am generally unwilling to travel regularly for business. Exceptions can of course
        be made if it's the sort of travel my family can come on (not necessarily at the company's expense).
      </p>
      <p>My most up to date resume can be found:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>in web/html format: <a class="link upper" href="/live-resume.html">live resume</a></li>
        <li>in PDF format: <a class="link upper" target="blank" href="/resume.pdf">pdf</a></li>
      </ul>
