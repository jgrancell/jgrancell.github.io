      <h1>My Passion Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I am regularly working on 2-3 main passion projects. These are multi-year projects that have caught
        my imagination, or are projects that I believe could be widely used if I decided to market them.
      </p>

      <!-- Metasync -->
      <h2>Metasync</h2>

      </p>
      <p>
        Metasync helps simplify managing multiple application repositories by letting you commit your meta files into
        a template directory and keep them synced to any number of application repositories. Meta files include things
        like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CI/CD files (.gitlab-ci.yml, .travis.yml, etc)</li>
        <li>Language files (Rakefiles, Makefiles, Composer.json/Package.json and similar package manager files)</li>
        <li>License files</li>
        <li>Ignore files (gitignores, dockerignores, etc)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With metasync, you can version your template files in a repository and have your application repositories
        pinned to a specific version, or kept up to date on a live and ever-changing branch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Metasync saves you time by letting you update a single file in your template, and then running a CLI command 
        to update your application repository. You don't need to copy and paste or manually update any more. I personally
        use the tool on all of my PHP and Golang applications to keep ~10 files per repository in sync across 
        ~15 repositories.
      </p>

        Raidkeeper is a tool that I wrote for my World of Warcraft guild. It lets us manage our raiding roster
        and keep track of our characters development over a raiding tier, saving us hours of time every week.
        Features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roster management</li>
        <li>Automatic fetching of roster character equipment, raid logs, and mythic plus scores.</li>
        <li>Weekly tracking of target goals, such as M+ dungeon completion.</li>
        <li>Integration with Discord to provide daily updates towards weekly goals.</li>
        <li>Analysis of raid composition to determine class or spec deficits or missing buffs.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Turtleshell -->

      <p>
        Turtleshell was my first attempt to really dig into Go. Since I learn best from actually writing
        something, I decided to write a Linux shell. I know...ambitious. But it was and continues to be
        one of my favorite projects. I'm mostly done with writing Turtleshell, though I hope one day to
        come back to it and learn how to write a programming language through adding Turtlescript to it.
        Features of Turtleshell include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability to run binaries on the system and interact with the filesystem.</li>
        <li>A number of custom written shell builtins, such as "cd", "echo", etc.</li>
        <li>The ability to read shell configurations from .turtlerc files.</li>
        <li>The ability to customize the shell prompt, which updates in real time.</li>
        <li>History saving, including optional timestamps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As I said, I do hope one day to write Shellang, the Turtleshell shell scripting language. Learing
        to write a Lexical parser and other aspects of a programming language is something I am very keen
        to do, and Turtleshell provides an excellent home for that. Perhaps one day if/when I have time.
