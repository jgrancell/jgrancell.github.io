  <h1>Why I Wrote Metasync</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Topic: Coding | Published: January 19, 2022
  </p>
  <p>
    I am often struck by inspiration to write applications. You could almost call it collecting 
    proto-applications. In any given month I'll commit code to 2-3 of my existing projects and 
    start another 1-4.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, I often have to drudge through both updating my existing codebases with new tests,
    updated versions of languages for my CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes container images, and perform
    regular package updates to protect my code from vulnerabilities. All of this on top of having to
    start the process over for every new application. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter metasync. Metasync lets me define a template (say for a Golang CLI application), include as
    many static files as I want into the template (CI/CD files, standard tests, License files, README
    and CHANGELOG generation tools, etc), and then using a simple CLI command sync that template into
    my projects.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Templates?</h2>
  <p>
    I really don't like repeating things. Whether it's code, guides, documentation, or anything -- if
    it can be automated it ~should~ be automated. Building reusable templates allows me to follow one
    of the core tennants of software architecture: Don't Repeat Yourself. DRY coding means you are
    always thinking about how you can make your code modular and composable. The vast majority of the
    Golang metafiles I use are shared between both libraries and applications. Rather than redefining
    these files for every single library and application, I can define them once and reuse them endlessly.
  </p>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    One of my first forays into DevOps was through Puppet Configuration Management. Puppet has a supporting
    tool called Modulesync which lets you sync some of the Puppet module scaffolding between your various
    modules. Metasync is my own take on Modulesync, not limited to Puppet modules but useful for any codebase.
  </p>
  <h2>How I'm Using It</h2>
  <p>
    I currently have a number of templates set up that I am using with Metasync. These include templates
    for PHP code, for Golang code, and for GitOps/Kubernetes code. With these templates I can update my CI/CD
    tests, dependencies, and supporting files in a single place and let my CI pipelines fetch metafile updates
    on a regular schedule.
  </p>
  <h2>Where Metasync Goes From Here</h2>
  <p>
    Ideally, Metasync will one day support Golang-style templating within actual template files. In this
    way Metasync templates will truly ~be~ templates -- the end user will be able to dynamically modify
    the content without having to repeat themselves endlessly in code. Sane defaults, sparing overrides.
