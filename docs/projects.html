  <h1>My Passion Projects</h1>
  <p>
    I am regularly working on 2-3 main passion projects. These are multi-year projects that have caught
    my imagination, or are projects that I believe could be widely used if I decided to market them.

  <!-- Metasync -->
  <h2>Metasync</h2>

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Metasync helps simplify managing multiple application repositories by letting you commit your meta files into
    a template directory and keep them synced to any number of application repositories. Meta files include things
    like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>CI/CD files (.gitlab-ci.yml, .travis.yml, etc)</li>
    <li>Language files (Rakefiles, Makefiles, Composer.json/Package.json and similar package manager files)</li>
    <li>License files</li>
    <li>Ignore files (gitignores, dockerignores, etc)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With metasync, you can version your template files in a repository and have your application repositories
    pinned to a specific version, or kept up to date on a live and ever-changing branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Metasync saves you time by letting you update a single file in your template, and then running a CLI command 
    to update your application repository. You don't need to copy and paste or manually update any more. I personally
    use the tool on all of my PHP and Golang applications to keep ~10 files per repository in sync across 
    ~15 repositories.

  <p>
    Raidkeeper is a tool that I wrote for my World of Warcraft guild. It lets us manage our raiding roster
    and keep track of our characters development over a raiding tier, saving us hours of time every week.
    Features include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Roster management</li>
    <li>Automatic fetching of roster character equipment, raid logs, and mythic plus scores.</li>
    <li>Weekly tracking of target goals, such as M+ dungeon completion.</li>
    <li>Integration with Discord to provide daily updates towards weekly goals.</li>
    <li>Analysis of raid composition to determine class or spec deficits or missing buffs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Raidkeeper saves us time, makes running a raid team less of a job, and helps me scratch an itch to
    build highly complex applications.

  <!-- Turtleshell -->
  <h2>Turtleshell</h2>
  <p>
    <img class="badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-golang-blue?style=square&logo=go">
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/jgrancell/turtleshell">
      <img class="badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/repository-jgrancell/turtleshell-black?style=square&logo=Github">
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Turtleshell was my first attempt to really dig into Go. Since I learn best from actually writing
    something, I decided to write a Linux shell. I know...ambitious. But it was and continues to be
    one of my favorite projects. I'm mostly done with writing Turtleshell, though I hope one day to
    come back to it and learn how to write a programming language through adding Turtlescript to it.
    Features of Turtleshell include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ability to run binaries on the system and interact with the filesystem.</li>
    <li>A number of custom written shell builtins, such as "cd", "echo", etc.</li>
    <li>The ability to read shell configurations from .turtlerc files.</li>
    <li>The ability to customize the shell prompt, which updates in real time.</li>
    <li>History saving, including optional timestamps.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As I said, I do hope one day to write Shellang, the Turtleshell shell scripting language. Learing
    to write a Lexical parser and other aspects of a programming language is something I am very keen
    to do, and Turtleshell provides an excellent home for that. Perhaps one day if/when I have time.
