  <h1>Background</h1>
  <p>
    I am an Automation, Reliability, and Infrastructure Engineer focusing on configuration, automation, 
    and infrastructure-as-code. An expert in highly available, fault tolerant web infrastructure, I 
    have architected and deployed web, game, and commerce infrastructure supporting the business 
    operations of Fortune 50 and 500 companies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently employed by Blizzard Entertainment as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer, focusing on 
    massive-scale Kubernetes, Terraform, Insfrastructure-As-Code, and other infrastructure projects. 
    I have worked as a DevOps Engineer and as a Linux System Administrator at previous organizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    When not working, I am often contributing to open source projects. I run several open source projects, 
    which can be found in my <a class="link upper" href="/projects.html">projects</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not actively looking for employment, nor am I actively looking to leave my current employer. 
    I will consider non-remote positions only for exotic destinations such as Hawaii, the Carribbean, 
    and New Jersey. I will not take positions that require travel outside of exotic island destinations.
