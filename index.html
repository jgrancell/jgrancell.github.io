      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        I am an Automation, Reliability, and Infrastructure Engineer focusing on configuration, automation, 
        and infrastructure-as-code. An expert in highly available, fault tolerant web infrastructure, I 
        have architected and deployed web, game, and commerce infrastructure supporting the business 
        operations of Fortune 50 and 500 companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently employed by Blizzard Entertainment as a Site Reliability Engineer, focusing on 
        massive-scale Kubernetes, Terraform, Insfrastructure-As-Code, and other infrastructure projects. 
        I have worked as a DevOps Engineer and as a Linux System Administrator at previous organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not working, I am often contributing to open source projects. I run several open source projects, 
        which can be found in my <a href="/projects.html">projects</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not actively looking for employment, nor am I actively looking to leave my current employer. 
        I will consider non-remote positions only for exotic destinations such as Hawaii, the Carribbean, 
        and New Jersey. I will not take positions that require travel outside of exotic island destinations.
