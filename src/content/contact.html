  <h1>If You're Not A Recruiter</h1>
  <p>
    If you're interested in discussing any of my projects, technology, how bad Texas barbeque is, or how
    cool hippos are then feel free to reach out. I'm available at:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <img class="logos" src="/img/discord.svg" alt="Discord Messenger">
      Discord: Ashkrall#0001
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Putting all of those logos in really pointed out how blue everything is these days. I should change the
    theme of this website...

  <h1>For Recruiters</h1>
  <p>
    Recruiters that have made it this far should  email me at josh [dot] grancell [at] gmail [dot] com. 
    I get a number of Linkedin messages every day, so by using this email your message is much more 
    likely to be seen.

    I am not currently actively searching for a new job or career, however I'm happy to network with 1-2
    recruiters, especially if you specialize in the Philadelpha metropolitan area.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am willing to entertain offers for positions that primarily involve any of the below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Terraform</li>
    <li>Golang</li>
    <li>Site Reliability Engineering</li>
    <li>DevOps Management</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I am willing to relocate to interesting and exciting places, such as Hawaii, an island in the 
    Carribbean, Europe or the UK (we used to live in Germany, and I have basic language skills in 
    French) or the Philadelphia/New Jersey area (not a joke, our family is from there and my wife's 
    extended family still lives there).
  </p>
  <p>
    I have small children, so I am generally unwilling to travel regularly for business. Exceptions can of course
    be made if it's the sort of travel my family can come on (not necessarily at the company's expense).
  </p>
  <p>My most up to date resume can be found:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in web/html format: <a class="link upper" href="/live-resume.html">live resume</a></li>
    <li>in PDF format: <a class="link upper" target="blank" href="/resume.pdf">pdf</a></li>
  </ul>
