  <h1>Sometimes I Write About Things</h1>
  <p>
    Sometimes my projects need some explanation, and other times I just like to write down about
    things that I have learned or think I may want to link others one day. To that end, voila!

    I am often struck by inspiration to write applications. You could almost call it collecting 
    proto-applications. In any given month I'll commit code to 2-3 of my existing projects and 
    start another 1-4.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, I often have to drudge through both updating my existing codebases with new tests,
    updated versions of languages for my CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes container images, and perform
    regular package updates to protect my code from vulnerabilities. All of this on top of having to
    start the process over for every new application. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter metasync. Metasync lets me define a template (say for a Golang CLI application), include as
    many static files as I want into the template (CI/CD files, standard tests, License files, README
    and CHANGELOG generation tools, etc), and then using a simple CLI command sync that template into
    my projects.
