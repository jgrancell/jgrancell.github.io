<h1 class="title">Sanderson's Cosmere - My Suggested Reading Order</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h1>The Cosmere</h1>
  <p>
    By and large, if you read the Cosmere in published order you are safe. That being said, there
    are connections between the books that can be better understood if you read them in a specific
    order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Books published before <i>The Lost Metal</i> are more or less standalone, however books published
    after <i>The Lost Metal</i> (excluding Tress and Yumi) are more interlinked and your comprehension
    will benefit from reading previous books first.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reading order suggested below is my own, based on my own readings of the Cosmere and discussion
    with others.

<div class="section">
  <h1>Suggested Reading Order</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="list-title">Warbreaker and Mistborn Era 1</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Warbreaker is a great standalone book if you want to get your feet wet, without committing to 3 books to start.</li>
        <li>Mistborn Era 1 is the first 3 large books Sanderson published, and while compelling are some of his rougher works since they're earlier..</li>
        <li>You will want to read all both Mistborn Era 1 and Warbreaker before moving on.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="list-title">Elantris</span>
